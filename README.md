# AutoTurnOnHotspot
Turn on Mobile Hotspot of Windows 10 when logging in

## Usage
1. Put these files in the same folder that you won't delete, rename or move
2. Run EnableAutoTurnOnHotspot.ps1
3. To disable this function, run DisableAutoTurnOnHotspot.ps1

## Implementation
The script that turning on the hotspot is copied from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65912082/4182574), **that's not my original work**! Basically, what I do is putting this script into the `Scheduled Tasks`.
